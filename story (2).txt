Once upon a time a long long time ago in a P A R E L L E L U N I V E  R S E(edited)
there was nothing
but then suddenly
due to quantom fluxuations
somthing oddhappened
a huge capitol class shellcore appered
it didnt have a known faction
from this shellcore all primal cores evolved making the primal cores the first faction(edited)
the abandoned sectors used to be thriving and teeming with shellcores
the faction of the first shellcore was unknown
then one day
a fleet of these shellcores
went out and explored the core and didnt come back
they evolved into the first corelings
they had lived there for centuries alone harnessing the power of the core
eventualy alot of factions branch our from the corelings aand a few branch off the primal cores
then one day
a new race the green cores broke off for unknow reasons
thye become quite succesful
being a jack of all trades
then one day
somthing unknown ahppened to the core
and it relesed a bucnh of suicided drones called infectors
that exploded spredding the ifnection
though it onl tinfected the corelings and green cores
the green cores sent some scouts to see what happened and they didnt come back they sent more powerful cores whcih was a bad idea
they became infected and built a new spawning grounds for the ifnected

it's like something in a sophisticated machine
Colonizor48Today at 11:02 AM
this started the first scetor war the ifnected and infected corelings vs the green cores and primal cores

hmm you probably need some help proofreading
Colonizor48Today at 11:04 AM
the green cores and primal core sbearlign won causing a truce to forurm between the green and primals and ifnected
the virus also altered the reality of thsoe infected
makking themthink the greencores wer eifnected but once they won they became freidns
after that the abanded sctors were well abanded leaving a few factions alone mainly because of the use of chorched earth tactictics there

I think I could creates another role named Proofreaders or Assist Writers
Colonizor48Today at 11:07 AM
but then
somthing happened
a coup happened and
it was succesful
the new infected government still beleved they were the true uninfected
the ones loyal to the old governments went into hidding in the abandoned scetors
they fourmed deadzones and invaded the uninfected
i think @Avocato  whould be a good assist writer(edited)
Shell-CoreToday at 11:13 AM
I just made an @Assist Writers role
Colonizor48Today at 11:14 AM
this started the second scetor war
also all infected corelings were a part of the rebels
the main reason they made deadzones was to trap the resistence and uninfected
and the infected were winning untill one day
you spawn
also a spinnof when you play as a green commander during the first scetor war
i nominate @Avocato  as an assist writer
also some of the rebels went into hidding in the hidden scetors between deadzoens
